#	Conduct hypothesis tests to determine if the following lead to more cancer incidence Use alpha of 5%. 
#. a.	Recent trend stable vs falling (Column M)
#. b.	Study Count (Column C). Create a new variable to recode this As High vs Low and do the hypothesis test. Break the two groups at the mean study count.

## hypothesis test about the recenTrend ##

cancerdeaths$recentTrend <- as.factor(cancerdeaths$recentTrend)
falling <- subset(cancerdeaths, recentTrend == "falling")$incidenceRate
stable <- subset(cancerdeaths, recentTrend == "stable")$incidenceRate

## The H0 there are no differences between the mean of incidence Rate considering the recenttrend is falling or stable ##
## The Ha is there are differences ##
## To reject the Null Hypothesis, the p_value must be below the alpha ##

t.test(falling, stable)

## Hypothesis test about the incidenceRate level ##

## Create the extra column with the level about the mean of studycount ##

## We stablished the mean of cases per location (zip code) ##
## The we used this mean to create a level ##
## above the mean, cancer level is High, Below the mean, cancer level is low ##

st_mean <- mean(cancerdeaths$studyCount)
cancerdeaths$level <- ifelse(cancerdeaths$studyCount >= st_mean, "high", "low")

## The hypothesis test ##

## Then we subset the incidencerate per location with high level and low level ##

high <- subset(cancerdeaths, level =="high")$incidenceRate
low <- subset(cancerdeaths, level == "low")$incidenceRate

## The H0 hypothesis there are no diferences between the mean of incidenceRate of High levels and Low levels ##
## THe Ha Hypothesis There are differences ##

t.test(high, low)


## Plot of recentTrend per incidence Rate ##

geom_point(aes(color = level), position = "jitter", alpha = 1/4)
