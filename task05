## Create an actionable regression model for incidence rate. ##
## It should explain as much of the variability as possible but only identify the most important factors.##

## We developed these 03 models ##



lm.fit <- lm(incidenceRate ~ log10(PovertyEst) + Name)

plot(lm.fit)

lm.fit1 <- lm(incidenceRate ~ poly(zipCode, 5) + State + log10(PovertyEst) + Name + log10(popEst2015))

plot(lm.fit1)

lm.fit2 <- lm(incidenceRate ~ poly(zipCode, 5) + lev_income)

plot(lm.fit2)
