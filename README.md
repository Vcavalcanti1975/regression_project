# The study about cancer incidence rate in US.
# We were hired by American Cancer Society (https://www.cancer.org/) to write a white paper exploring the factors related to cancer deaths in the US. They will use your analysis to identify regions (and associated partners) for cancer interventions across the US. The dataset provided includes information about all zipcodes in the United States.
